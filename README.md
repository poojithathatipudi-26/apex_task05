Final Project: ProductHub – A Mini Product Listing & To-Do Web App
✅ Objective
Build a complete, dynamic, and user-friendly web application to showcase products and manage tasks with full dark mode and mobile responsiveness.

🔧 Step 1: Build the Full Application (Capstone)
✅ Tech Stack:
HTML – Structure (index.html, products.html, todo.html)

CSS – Styling (style.css with responsive and dark mode)

JavaScript – Dynamic features (main.js, products.js, todo.js)

✅ Core Features:
🛍️ Product Listing with image, price, description, and search

📝 To-Do List with priority tags, task count, animations, and local storage

🌗 Dark Mode toggle with saved preferences

📱 Fully responsive design for mobile and tablet

🎨 Tooltips and hover effects for better UX

🚀 Step 2: Optimize for Performance
✅ What Was Done:
✅ Minimized HTML, CSS, and JS files — clean and structured

✅ Used system fonts and lazy animations

✅ Image optimization – used compressed PNGs (or lazy loaded if desired)

✅ Reduced HTTP requests by loading all scripts/styles locally

✅ Responsive grid & layout — tested for mobile, tablet, and desktop

🌍 Step 3: Ensure Cross-Browser & Device Compatibility
✅ Tested On:
✔️ Chrome ✅

✔️ Firefox ✅

✔️ Safari ✅

✔️ Android/Chrome ✅

✔️ iPhone/Safari ✅

✅ Responsive Features:
Uses flex-wrap, grid, media queries, and scalable font/image sizes

Layout adjusts smoothly between 320px (mobile) and 1440px+ (desktop)
